This is to simulate a connection the machine where the Colima cluster is running:
colima ssh -p k8s28

This is to grpcurl in the machine where you need to use it:
curl -fsSL -o grpcurl_1.9.1_linux_x86_64.tar.gz https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl/releases/download/v1.9.1/grpcurl_1.9.1_linux_x86_64.tar.gz
tar xvzf grpcurl_1.9.1_linux_x86_64.tar.gz
sudo mv grpcurl /usr/local/bin/

For a grpc app this will tell you which services/endpoints are in that app:
grpcurl -max-time 30 -max-msg-sz 41943040 --plaintext 10.42.0.81:9002 describe 

This is to execute one of those endpoints:
grpcurl -max-time 30 -max-msg-sz 41943040 --plaintext -d '{"currency": "XXX"}' exchange-rate-service.default:9003 ExchangeRateService/GetExchangeRate


To get a shell in a runnig container in a pod:
kubectl exec -it exchange-rate --container exchange-rate  -- /bin/sh

To test if the service name can be resolved through DNS:
nslookup exchange-rate-service.default

If your container is to restrictive (can't do sudo, can't install apos), you can dinamically attach a less restrictive container to a running pod:
kubectl debug -it radixts-0 --target=timescaledb --image=bellsoft/liberica-openjdk-centos
